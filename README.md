ChitChat is an app to help organizations chat better. Users can create conversations, post messages, and reply to those messages. There are also additional features to make it easier for users to get the information that they want. For example, if a word is prefaced by a hashtag, it is grouped with other messages on the same topic. Also, the messages with the most replies are shown on the homepage. Lastly, admins can leave announcements that are relevant to the organization as a whole.

The app is built using Ruby on Rails with HTML/CSS for the front end. Future additions to the app will include:

1) Sophisticated searching so that users can easily locate previous posts.
2) Incorporation of JavaScript to make the user experience better, specifically with the various buttons for replying/editing/deleting messages.

I built this project as my breakable toy when I was a Launch Academy student during the Winter 2014 cohort.

The app is deployed on Heroku: http://chitchatbetter.herokuapp.com/
